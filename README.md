# Fake News Detector README

## Introduction

In this repository, I've developed a robust tool to distinguish between fake news and genuine news articles. In this README, I'll provide you with an overview of the project's capabilities, a brief explanation of how it works, and snippets of the key aspects of the implementation.

## Project Overview

The Fake News Detector utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, including word embedding, one-hot representation, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to accurately classify news articles. My primary goal is to identify reliable news sources and combat misinformation.

## Distinctive Features

Make use of these concepts by referring to the .py files available in this repository

- **Word Embedding**: I made use of word embedding techniques, transforming textual data into compact numerical vectors that capture nuanced semantic associations between words.

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical attributes are transformed into binary vectors through one-hot encoding, ensuring a rich and informative input for my LSTM-based model.

- **LSTM-Based Classification**: At the heart of my system is the LSTM network, a highly adaptable neural network architecture adept at processing the encoded data, enabling it to model sequence patterns and context for precise classifications.
